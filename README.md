## Invisible Mobile Keyboard (IMK) with Self-Attention Neural Character Decoder (SA-NCD)
Official data and Pytorch implementation of "Type Anywhere You Want: An Introduction to Invisible Mobile Keyboard" (IJCAI 2021, Accepted)

This repository provides IMK dataset, codes for training the baseline decoder SA-NCD. Please refer to our [paper]() 


### Dataset Download
The raw dataset is in ```data/raw```.
The model is trained on normalized dataset which can be downloaded from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eP2ZnxI1zzvtyyr_iQ_AAnRzyXgV59bI/view?usp=sharing).
The normalized dataset contains a x, y location coordinates divided by the used device width and height, so they can be in range of [0, 1].
